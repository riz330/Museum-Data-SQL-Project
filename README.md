# MuseumData_Project

Project Overview:
The MuseumData_Project contains a database that includes various tables such as museum, artist, work, product_size, museum_hours, and more. This project demonstrates SQL queries used for various data retrieval and manipulation tasks, such as joining tables, grouping data, calculating aggregates, and more.

Files and Queries Overview:
Database Creation:

The database is named museumdata and includes several tables storing information about artists, artworks, museums, and associated metadata (canvas sizes, product sizes, etc.).
sql
Copy code
create database museumdata;
use museumdata;
Table Viewing and Exploration:

This step retrieves data from all major tables (artist, museum, work, etc.) for exploration.
sql
Copy code
show tables;
select * from artist;
select * from work;
Joins and Data Queries:

Various SQL queries use joins to link related tables and retrieve detailed insights. For example, joining work, artist, and museum to show which artistâ€™s works are displayed in which museums.
sql
Copy code
select a.full_name, w.name as workname, m.name as museumname
from work as w
inner join artist as a on a.artist_id = w.artist_id
inner join museum as m on w.museum_id = m.museum_id;
Aggregations and Grouping:

Queries that aggregate data, such as counting the number of works by each artist or finding the total sale price of their works.
sql
Copy code
select full_name, count(*) as CountOfWorkDoneByArtist 
from data
group by full_name
order by CountOfWorkDoneByArtist desc;
Top Museums and Works:

SQL queries that retrieve the top 5 museums with the most works displayed, as well as other queries that show the most profitable works and highest-selling artists.
sql
Copy code
select museumname, count(*) as noofwork  
from abc
group by museumname
order by noofwork desc
limit 5;
Conditional Queries:

Example queries retrieve works with specific conditions, such as artworks sold for less than their regular price.
sql
Copy code
select * from xux
where sale_price < regular_price
order by sale_price desc;
Summarizing Data:

Calculations like the average height and width of works, the maximum sale price per museum, and artists with more than 3 works in the database.
sql
Copy code
select artwork, avg(width), avg(height)
from qwe
group by artwork;
How to Use This Project:
Set Up Database:

Run the provided SQL commands to create the database museumdata and its associated tables.
Populate tables with appropriate data using INSERT statements or import scripts.
Query Execution:

Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to extract insights from the dataset, such as which artists' works are displayed in specific museums or sales-related information.
Modifications:

Users can modify and extend the SQL queries to suit their specific needs. For example, adding new conditions, adjusting groupings, or applying different filtering criteria.
Important Notes:
This project assumes the user is familiar with basic SQL concepts, including joins, groupings, and aggregations.
Ensure that the data within the tables follows the expected structure (e.g., artist_id and work_id are correctly linked between the artist and work tables).
For performance improvements, it is recommended to use indexing on columns used frequently in join and group operations (e.g., artist_id, museum_id, etc.).
